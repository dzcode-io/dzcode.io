## Coding Guidelines

In addition to the following guidelines, please follow the conventions already
established in the code.

- **Spacing**:<br>
  Use two spaces for indentation. No tabs.

- **Naming**:<br>
  Keep variable & method names concise & descriptive.<br>
  Variable names `index`, `array`, & `iteratee` are preferable to
  `i`, `arr`, & `fn`.

- **Quotes**:<br>
  Double-quoted strings are chosen over single-quoted strings; to avoid unnecessary escaping.

- **Comments**:<br>
  Please use single-line comments to annotate significant additions, &
  [JSDoc-style](http://www.2ality.com/2011/08/jsdoc-intro.html) comments for
  functions.

Guidelines are following the [.editorconfig](https://github.com/dzcode-io/dzcode.io/blob/master/.editorconfig) file.
