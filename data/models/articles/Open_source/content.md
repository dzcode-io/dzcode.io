# What is open source?

&nbsp;
According to opensource.com :

The term open source refers to something people can modify and share because its design is publicly accessible.

Before getting into its formal definition, let us first understand where did the combination of “open” and “source” comes from. The term “open source” was conceived in a strategy session held by the Free Software Movement on February 3rd, 1998 in Palo Alto, California.

The term was coined to label the type of software whose source code is available to everyone, with four basic permissions:

1. you can view the code
2. you can use the code
3. you can change the code
4. you can share the code.

## Little history

In the late 1950s and beginning of the 1960s, computers were considered one unite of an inseparable combination of hardware and software. When you buy the hardware you get the software for free, where you can use it, fix its bugs, or add new functions to it.
In that era, the software was created a shared openly and was not seen as a commodity in itself. Unfortunately, that didn’t last very long. Because by late 1960, the software production costs were dramatically increasing relative to hardware. This had lead to massive competition between software manufacturers to produce low-cost software that meets the customer's needs.

&nbsp;

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, computer vendors and software-only companies began routinely charging for software licenses, marketing software as "Program Products".
Then in 1974 US Commission on New Technological Uses of Copyrighted Works (CONTU) decided that "computer programs, to the extent that they embody an author's original creation, are the proper subject matter of copyright".

&nbsp;

To increase revenues, a general trend began to no longer distribute source code, and only distribute the executable machine code. However, these new practices were not met with welcoming arms. One person especially distressed by this new behavior was Richard Stallman. He was annoyed because he could no longer study or modify programs written by others. Stallman viewed this practice as ethically wrong. In response, he founded the GNU Project in 1983 so that people could use computers using only free software. He then established a non-profit organization, the Free Software Foundation, and in 1985, he invented copyleft, a legal mechanism to preserve the "free" status of a work subject to copyright, and implemented this in the GNU General Public License.

## How do open-source works?

&nbsp;
An open-source project is created, developed, and maintained by a community of volunteers. This community uses an open-source development model to manage and produce finished artifacts. The produced software is then released under an open-source license.

Because there more then one person working on the code, many OSS projects use a distributed version control system to manage all the changes; with the principle repository hosted on a remote server. Generally, most OSS projects are hosted on GitHub. These projects range from full-fledged software like Linux, Ansible, and Kubernetes.

Because an OSS can have hundreds and even thousands of volunteers working on it, chaos is bound to happen if there is no good management. To prevent that from happening a group of maintainers gets appointed by the organization of the project. This team of maintainers works on reviewing the submitted contributions, assigning bug issues, and choosing which features to work on for the next release.

&nbsp;

The open-source development model consists of 5 main steps:

1. Someone or a group of people choose an idea to work on and turn into reality.
2. They create a remote repository to use as the main container of the code, this repository is named the upstream.
3. Everyone wants to get involved in the project fork the repository to their respective account. This copy-like repository is named the origin, each account has its origin.
4. When a member introduces a new change or a fix to a bug, he/she pushes it to his/her origin. Then create a pull request to the upstream repository.
5. One of the maintainers of the project review the changes made in the pull request and decides if its good to merge into the projects or it needs more work.

## Why you should contribute to open source?

&nbsp;

- Make the world a better place: when you help in creating free and liberal software you are contributing to the whole world. For example, if you contribute to project like Vue, you are not only making things easier for other developers, you are helping all the people that use any website created by Vue.

- Experience: the best way to learn how to program is to do more programming. The second best way is to see how others do it. Open-source repositories are a great place that combines both. It does not matter if you don’t have experience working in an actual job, because an active GitHub will open up great doors.

- Exposure: Active open-source contributions emphasize your expertise and knowledge more than certificates alone will ever do. By contributing to OSS you set skills out to notice by potential employers. Don’t tell them that you can do the job. Show them.

- Networking: Because working on OSS involves interacting with others. Contributing to OSS will allow you to meet new interesting people, exchange ideas, and grow as a developer. Setting aside time to work on OSS can spark plenty of quality discussions, even end up in friendships, or finding a mentor.
