# What?

Creating a “fork” is producing a personal copy of someone else’s project. Forks act as a sort of bridge between the original repository and your personal copy

# Why?

It's needed mainly for two reasons:

## Propose changes to someone else's project

You want to contribute to a project, but you don't have **Write** access to it, the only way you can make changes in this case, is by forking this project into your account, make the changes there, then create a [Pull-Request](/Learn/Git_Basics/Pull_Merge_Request) but make sure this PR is targeting the original repository aka upstream, this PR will show up on the original project, and it's up to the maintainers to accept or request more changes before merging it.

## Use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea

Open source software is based on the idea that by sharing code, we can make better, more reliable software.

When creating your public repository from a fork of someone's project, make sure to include a license file that determines how you want your project to be shared with others.

# How?

the best up-to-date place to learn how to fork, is in [Github docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)
