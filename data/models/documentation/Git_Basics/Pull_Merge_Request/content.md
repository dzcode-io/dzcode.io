# Pull Request vs Merge Request

Well, they are the exact same thing, just different names.

# What?

Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.

# Why?

pull requests is a mechanism for a developer to notify team members that a feature or fix, developed on a separate branch, is ready. This lets everybody involved know that they can review the code, providing a forum discussing the implementation of the proposed feature.

# How?

it's simple, it's just that each provider has its own GUI steps to do it:

- [Gitlab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/creating_merge_requests.html)
