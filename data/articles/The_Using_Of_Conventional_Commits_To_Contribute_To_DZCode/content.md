# Use conventional commits to contribute to dzcode

Yoo there i just want to share with you a standard to write commits, and i know that most of us struggle to come up with an appropriate commit messages.
I was experiencing the same thing, but one day I found out about this conventional commits after reading this [article](https://dev.to/alvarotorresc/conventional-commits-1an9) by Alvaro Torres Carrasco

## Why commits is important

Some describe the commits as the first way to communicate with your team , and i think that you should write a good commit messages even when you work alone ,because this personal project might became an open source project and there will be lot of other developers who want to contribute !!!

## What is conventional commits

A specification for adding human and machine readable meaning to commit messages

Conventional commits make it easier for other developers who want to understand what the hell is going on a specific project

Another definition from the ['official conventional commits website'](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

> The Conventional Commits specification is a lightweight convention on top of commit messages. It provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history; which makes it easier to write automated tools on top of. This convention dovetails with semver.org , by describing the features, fixes, and breaking changes made in commit messages.....
